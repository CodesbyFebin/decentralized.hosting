    difficulty: 'Beginner',
    timeMinutes: 5,
    claimStatus: 'IMPLEMENTED',
    prerequisites: [
      'GOOGLE_API_KEY set on the control plane (see the AI Assistant reference doc)',
      'At least one deployment that failed or is behaving unexpectedly'
    ],
    architectureOverview: 'The Assistant tab is a single Gemini model with exactly four read-only tools -- list_deployments, get_deployment_logs, list_nodes, get_release_history (control-plane/app/routers/assistant.py). It cannot deploy, delete, restart, or change anything; its system instruction explicitly tells it to decline and point you at the right CLI command or console button instead. That makes it genuinely safe to ask broad, exploratory questions about a broken deployment without worrying it will "fix" something on its own.',
    steps: [
      {
        title: 'Step 1: Open the Assistant tab',
        description: 'In the console, with a failed or misbehaving deployment already showing in the Deployments tab.',
        command: '# console -> Assistant tab'
      },
      {
        title: 'Step 2: Ask a direct question',
        description: 'The model calls get_deployment_logs and/or get_release_history itself -- you don\'t need to paste logs in manually.',
        command: '"Why is my-service failing to start? Check its logs and recent releases."'
      },
      {
        title: 'Step 3: Read the tool-backed answer',
        description: 'A real answer references what the tools actually returned, not a generic guess -- e.g. quoting the specific error line from the last ~200 log lines, or noting the last release\'s status.',
        output: `Looking at my-service's logs, the container is exiting immediately with:
  "ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'fastapi'"

This means requirements.txt wasn't picked up correctly during the build.
The last release (rel_8f3a1) shows status "deployed" but the container
has since crashed -- check that requirements.txt is at your project root,
then redeploy with \`dhost ship my-service\`.`
      },
      {
        title: 'Step 4: Act on it yourself',
        description: 'The assistant never runs the fix -- you redeploy, roll back, or restart via the CLI or console as normal.',
        command: 'dhost ship my-service'
      }
    ],
    troubleshooting: [
      {
        issue: 'The input box is disabled / greyed out',
        resolution: 'GOOGLE_API_KEY isn\'t set on the control plane -- GET /assistant/status is reporting enabled: false. This is by design: no fake response when it\'s not configured.'
      },
      {
        issue: 'The assistant says it can\'t help with something',
        resolution: 'If you asked it to deploy, delete, or change state, that\'s expected -- it has no tools for that. Use the CLI or console for the actual action; ask the assistant for diagnosis, not execution.'
      }
    ],
    securityConsiderations: [
      'The assistant only reads deployment/node/release data already visible in your own console -- it has no broader system access, and nothing you ask it can mutate state.'
    ]
  }
