> Decentralized.Host is an open-source self-hosted deployment platform and distributed compute mesh for running containerized web applications across independently operated compute nodes.

## Core Capabilities
- CLI & Git Push Deployments: Automated Docker packaging and container scheduling via \`dhost ship\` and SSH Git hooks.
- Multi-Node Compute Mesh: Decoupled Python node agent daemon reporting real-time CPU/RAM telemetry for weighted scheduler placement.
- Automatic Edge Routing: Traefik dynamic reverse proxy with automated Let's Encrypt SSL/TLS certificates.
- Zero Platform Lock-in: Runs standard OCI Docker containers on any Linux server, VPS, or bare-metal machine.

## Developer Quick Start
\`\`\`bash
# 1. Clone and install the CLI (not on PyPI yet)
git clone https://github.com/CodesbyFebin/decentralized.hosting.git
cd decentralized.hosting && pip install -e ./cli

# 2. Point at your control plane
export DHOST_API_URL=http://localhost:8000
export DHOST_DEPLOY_KEY=<your deploy API key>

# 3. Ship an app -- no Dockerfile, no Git required
cd my-app && dhost ship my-app
\`\`\`

export const dynamic = 'force-static';

export function GET() {
  return new Response(LLMS_TXT, {
    headers: { 'Content-Type': 'text/plain; charset=utf-8' },
  });
