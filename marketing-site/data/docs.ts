    content: `Decentralized.Host deploys any web application, API, or background container with one command, from your own machine or from a self-hosted control plane. Follow this guide to ship your first project against a mesh you're running (see the self-hosting guide to stand one up).

### 1. Install the CLI
The CLI isn't published to PyPI yet -- install it in editable mode from the repo:

\`\`\`bash
git clone https://github.com/CodesbyFebin/decentralized.hosting.git
cd decentralized.hosting
pip install -e ./cli
\`\`\`

### 2. Point it at your control plane
Set the URL and deploy key for the mesh you're targeting (defaults match a local \`docker compose up\` mesh):

\`\`\`bash
export DHOST_API_URL=http://localhost:8000
export DHOST_DEPLOY_KEY=your_deploy_api_key
\`\`\`

### 3. Ship your application
Navigate to your application directory (FastAPI, Next.js, Express, static, or anything with a custom Dockerfile) and run:

\`\`\`bash
cd my-app
dhost ship my-app
\`\`\`
The CLI detects your stack, snapshots the project locally (a real SHA-256 content-addressed ledger under \`.dhost/\` -- no Git required), uploads the snapshot, and the control plane builds and runs it on the mesh -- no Dockerfile needed in your repo, no local Docker required either. It prints your live URL when done.

### 4. Update it
\`\`\`bash
dhost update "what changed"
\`\`\`
Snapshots your current changes and redeploys. \`dhost history\` lists past snapshots; \`dhost rollback <snapshot-id>\` restores and redeploys an earlier one.`,
    codeBlocks: [
      {
        label: 'Bash Installation',
        language: 'bash',
        code: `pip install -e ./cli
dhost ship my-app

    content: `The \`dhost\` CLI talks to whatever control plane you point it at via two environment variables (or the \`.dhost/config.yml\` that \`dhost ship\`/\`init\` write automatically):

\`\`\`bash
export DHOST_API_URL=http://localhost:8000      # default if unset
export DHOST_DEPLOY_KEY=dev-deploy-key           # default if unset
\`\`\`

There is no global \`--url\`/\`--token\`/\`--json\` flag set -- auth is env-var or config-file based, not per-invocation flags.

### The Git-free path (recommended)
- \`dhost ship [name] [--port 8080] [--message/-m "ship"] [--domain <bare-domain>]\`: Detects your stack, snapshots the project into \`.dhost/ledger/\` (SHA-256 content-addressed, no Git), uploads it, and the control plane builds + runs it server-side. No Dockerfile needed in your repo. \`--domain\` binds a bare apex domain instead of \`<name>.<BASE_DOMAIN>\` (used for this project's own landing page, for example).
- \`dhost update "<message>"\`: Snapshots current changes and redeploys, reusing the name/port/domain from the last \`dhost ship\` in this directory.
- \`dhost history\`: Lists local snapshots for the current project (id, message, timestamp, file count) -- reads \`.dhost/ledger/\` on this machine only.
- \`dhost rollback <snapshot-id>\`: Restores a local snapshot to a temp sandbox and reships it.

### The older, local-build path
- \`dhost init\`: Writes a real \`Dockerfile\` to the project root (only if one doesn't exist) and creates \`.dhost/config.yml\`.
- \`dhost deploy [name] [--port 8080] [--registry localhost:5000]\`: Runs \`docker build\`/\`docker push\` on **your own machine** (needs local Docker), then schedules it -- distinct from \`dhost ship\`, not an alias.

### Status & logs
- \`dhost status <name>\`: Prints a deployment's status, image, node id, URL, and error (if any).
- \`dhost logs <name>\`: Prints the last ~200 lines of container logs.

### Mesh nodes
- \`dhost node join [--node-name <name>] [--control-plane-url <url>]\`: Builds and runs another node-agent container on this same Docker daemon -- for a genuinely separate machine, see the Self-Hosting / multi-node guide instead.
- \`dhost node list\`: Table of all nodes -- name, status, region, CPU%, RAM used, wallet.

### Git server & keys
- \`dhost keys add <label> <path-to-pubkey>\`: Registers an SSH public key allowed to \`git push\` to this mesh.
- \`dhost keys list\`: Lists registered keys with fingerprints.
- \`dhost clone-url <name> [--ssh-host localhost] [--ssh-port 2222]\`: Prints the git remote URL and setup commands for a repo.

### Node-operator credits (Solana devnet)
- \`dhost wallet <node_id> <solana_pubkey>\`: Links a devnet wallet to a node so it can receive credits.
- \`dhost credits <node_id>\`: Shows a node's credit balance and mint history.

There is no \`dhost list\` (all-deployments), \`dhost restart\`, \`dhost stop\`, or \`dhost destroy\` command -- tear down a deployment via the console's Delete button or \`DELETE /deployments/{name}\`.`,

    content: `There are two genuinely different setups here -- don't mix their env vars.

### Local development (no real domain needed)
\`\`\`bash
git clone https://github.com/CodesbyFebin/decentralized.hosting.git
cd decentralized.hosting
docker compose up -d --build
pip install -e ./cli
\`\`\`
This brings up Postgres, the registry, Traefik, the control plane, one node agent, the console, and the git server, all using \`.env.example\`'s dev defaults (\`BASE_DOMAIN=127.0.0.1.nip.io\` -- a free wildcard DNS service that resolves any \`*.127.0.0.1.nip.io\` to localhost, so you get real DNS + real Traefik routing with zero setup, just no real TLS).

### Real production (a real domain, real Let's Encrypt certs)
This needs a real server and real DNS -- see [DEPLOY.md](https://github.com/CodesbyFebin/decentralized.hosting/blob/main/DEPLOY.md) in the repo for the full walkthrough. Short version:

\`\`\`bash
# On a real VPS with Docker installed, DNS already pointed at it:
git clone https://github.com/CodesbyFebin/decentralized.hosting.git
cd decentralized.hosting
cp .env.example .env
# edit .env: real BASE_DOMAIN, real random SECRET_KEY/NODE_JOIN_SECRET/DEPLOY_API_KEY, real ACME_EMAIL
docker compose -f docker-compose.yml -f docker-compose.prod.yml up -d --build
\`\`\`
Note both compose files are required together -- the prod one is an overlay, not a replacement. This gets you \`api.<domain>\` (control plane) and \`app.<domain>\` (console) with real per-hostname Let's Encrypt certs (HTTP-01, no DNS-provider API key needed -- just a wildcard \`*.<domain>\` A record), and every future \`dhost ship\` also gets a real cert automatically.

### What's running either way
1. **Traefik** -- edge proxy, routes by hostname, TLS in production
2. **FastAPI control plane** -- scheduling, auth, the REST API
3. **Node agent** -- builds and runs containers on the Docker daemon it has access to
4. **git-server** -- the SSH git daemon (see the Git Server guide)
5. **Postgres** -- all state (nodes, deployments, releases, SSH keys)
6. **Console (dashboard)** -- the web UI, static nginx serving vanilla JS/HTML`,

### Real environment variables
- \`CONTROL_PLANE_URL\` (default \`http://control-plane:8000\`): where to register and send heartbeats

- \`NODE_REGION\` (default \`local\`): free-text label, not used for scheduling logic today
- \`ADVERTISE_ADDRESS\` (default \`node-agent:<LOG_API_PORT>\`): **the one that matters for a real remote node** -- must be reachable from the control plane specifically, e.g. \`203.0.113.5:8100\`
- \`REGISTRY_HOST\` (default \`registry:5000\`): where built images get pushed

Most endpoints take \`Authorization: Bearer <DEPLOY_API_KEY>\`. Node-to-control-plane endpoints (heartbeat, pending-deployments) instead take a short-lived JWT issued at \`/auth/node-join\` -- that's a separate trust boundary from the deploy key.

### Nodes
- \`GET /nodes\` -- list (deploy-key auth)

- \`POST /nodes/heartbeat\`, \`GET /nodes/{id}/pending-deployments\`, \`POST /nodes/{id}/deployment-status/{deployment_id}\` -- all node-JWT auth, called by the node agent itself, not something you'd call directly

### Git server keys
- \`POST /git/keys\`, \`GET /git/keys\`, \`DELETE /git/keys/{id}\` -- manage SSH keys (deploy-key auth)

    content: `### The restricted login shell
The \`git\` user's login shell is not \`/bin/bash\` or plain \`git-shell\` -- it's a small wrapper (git-server/opengit-shell.sh) that:
1. Reads the requested command (via \`-c\` argument when invoked as a login shell, or \`$SSH_ORIGINAL_COMMAND\` for a ForceCommand-style setup -- it handles both)
2. Pattern-matches it against exactly three allowed forms: \`git-upload-pack\`, \`git-receive-pack\`, \`git-upload-archive\`. Anything else is rejected before any real shell runs.
3. Extracts the repo name via \`basename()\` (so \`../../etc/passwd\` becomes just \`passwd\` -- no path traversal possible)
4. On \`git-receive-pack\` to a repo that doesn't exist yet, runs \`git init --bare\` and installs the post-receive hook, then execs the real \`git-shell -c\`

### The post-receive hook
Copied from git-server/post-receive.template into every repo's \`hooks/\` at creation time, with \`CONTROL_PLANE_URL\`/\`DEPLOY_API_KEY\` substituted in at container startup:
1. Reads which ref was just pushed and points the bare repo's \`HEAD\` at it (deploys whatever you last pushed -- there's no fixed "main branch" assumption, which also means a fresh repo has no ambiguity about what "the default branch" is)
2. \`git archive HEAD\` into a tarball (already respects \`.gitignore\`/export-ignore, so no separate ignore-list logic needed)
3. Reads an optional \`.opengit.yml\` at the repo root for \`port:\`/\`domain:\` overrides
4. POSTs the tarball to \`/deployments/push\` and prints the result back to your \`git push\` output

### SSH key sync
Registered keys live in Postgres (the \`SSHKey\` model), not directly in the container. The git-server container fetches \`GET /git/keys/authorized_keys\` once at startup and then every 30s in a background loop, so a newly-added key becomes usable within half a minute without a restart.

### What this does NOT have
No per-user accounts, no per-repo access control (any registered key can push to any repo), no branch protection, no PR/code-review workflow, no webhooks besides the deploy trigger itself.`,

### Dashboard
Live counts (nodes healthy, deployments running, releases shipped), blockchain status, and a recent-deployments list.

### Launchpad
Drag a project folder in; it uploads to \`/deployments/detect\`, shows the detected stack and an editable generated Dockerfile (plus a real Gemini note if \`GOOGLE_API_KEY\` is set on the control plane, otherwise it says so honestly), then Ship calls \`/deployments/ship\`. Exactly the same pipeline as \`dhost ship\` and \`git push\`.

### Deployments
Table of everything on the mesh; click one for status, the assigned node, and its last ~200 log lines, plus a real Delete button (\`DELETE /deployments/{name}\`).

### Git Manager
Real release history per deployment (message, snapshot id if it came from \`dhost ship\`, status, timestamp) via \`GET /deployments/{name}/releases\` -- plus a quick-command reference for the actual CLI/git-push workflows. This does not let you roll back from the browser; that still needs the local snapshot on whichever machine shipped it.

### Mesh Nodes
Live table from \`GET /nodes\` -- status, region, CPU%, RAM used, linked wallet.

### Credits
Per-node Solana devnet credit ledger, and an honest "off (ENABLE_BLOCKCHAIN=false)" state when it isn't configured.

### Why devnet, not mainnet
Devnet SOL and tokens have no monetary value -- funded by a free public faucet, not a purchase. That keeps this a genuine on-chain demonstration (real transactions, a real token mint, a real Explorer link) without touching real money or requiring anyone to buy anything. A mainnet path is an explicit future decision, not something this version does quietly.

### Setting it up
\`\`\`bash
pip install -r blockchain/requirements.txt
python blockchain/scripts/setup_devnet.py
\`\`\`
This generates a payer keypair, requests a free devnet airdrop (the public faucet is often rate-limited -- the script tells you if it fails and how to retry or fund manually), and creates the token mint. Copy the printed mint address into \`.env\`:
\`\`\`env
ENABLE_BLOCKCHAIN=true
SOLANA_MINT_ADDRESS=<printed mint address>
\`\`\`
Restart the control plane, then link a node's wallet:
\`\`\`bash
dhost wallet <node_id> <your-devnet-wallet-pubkey>
dhost credits <node_id>
\`\`\`

### What actually happens on-chain
Real \`solana-py\`/\`solders\` calls: associated-token-account creation if needed, then a real \`mint_to\` instruction. Every mint is recorded with its transaction signature and a working \`explorer.solana.com/...?cluster=devnet\` link, visible in the console's Credits tab or \`GET /blockchain/credits/{node_id}\`.`,

### The real schema (control-plane/app/models.py)
Five tables, nothing more:
- **Node** -- name, status, region, live CPU/RAM telemetry, and \`advertise_address\` (the reachable host:port the control plane uses to talk back to this specific node -- critical once you have more than one)
- **Deployment** -- name, image reference, assigned node, status, custom domain, container port
- **Release** -- one row per \`ship\`/\`update\`/git-push, message, snapshot id, status, timestamp -- this is what the console's Git Manager tab and \`GET /deployments/{name}/releases\` read
- **CreditLedger** -- one row per Solana devnet mint event, with the real transaction signature
- **SSHKey** -- registered public keys for the git server, label, and the pubkey itself

### Schema changes: no migration framework
There's no Alembic, no versioned migration files. On startup, \`Base.metadata.create_all()\` creates any tables that don't exist yet, then a short \`STARTUP_MIGRATIONS\` list of raw, idempotent \`ALTER TABLE ... ADD COLUMN IF NOT EXISTS\` statements in \`control-plane/app/main.py\` applies any additive changes to tables that already exist. It's intentionally minimal -- fine for a single-operator self-hosted mesh where you control both the code and the database, not something that would scale to a team needing rollback-able migrations or a review process on schema changes.

### Startup sequence
On boot, the control plane retries the database connection for up to 30 attempts (2s apart) before giving up -- this is what lets \`docker compose up\` bring up Postgres and the control plane in either order without a crash loop. \`GET /healthz\` returns \`{"status": "ok"}\` once the app is actually serving, useful for a real load balancer or orchestrator health check in front of it.`,

There's no seccomp profile customization, no dropped Linux capabilities, and no read-only root filesystem enforcement beyond Docker's own defaults. If your threat model requires stronger isolation than stock Docker (e.g. gVisor, Kata Containers, or gVisor-style sandboxing), that's not present in this version -- see the roadmap's Phase 3 (confidential computing) for where stronger isolation is planned, not yet built.

### The resource limit every container gets, hardcoded
Every container the node agent starts is capped at:
- **256MB memory** (\`mem_limit="256m"\`)
- **1 vCPU** (\`nano_cpus=1_000_000_000\`)

This is currently the same fixed limit for every deployment regardless of what the app actually needs -- there's no per-app override yet. A memory-hungry app will get OOM-killed at 256MB just like a tiny one; know this before shipping something that needs more headroom. Restart policy is \`unless-stopped\`, so a crashed container restarts automatically, but a container that's OOM-killed repeatedly will just keep restarting and dying rather than surfacing a clear "needs more memory" signal today.

### Networking
Every deployment container joins the same Docker network (the compose-defined mesh network) so Traefik can reach it by container IP; it is not exposed on a host port directly. Only Traefik's own ports (80/443, or the local dev port) are exposed to the outside world.`,
    codeBlocks: [
      {
        label: 'The actual container creation call (node-agent/agent.py)',
        language: 'python',
        code: `container = docker_client.containers.run(
    image,
    name=container_name,
    detach=True,
    network=MESH_NETWORK,
    restart_policy={"Name": "unless-stopped"},
    mem_limit="256m",
    nano_cpus=1_000_000_000,  # 1 vCPU cap
)`
      }
    ]
  }
];
