    question: 'Is Decentralized.Host a blockchain storage network like IPFS, Arweave, or Filecoin?',

"Decentralized" refers to distributing container workloads across independently operated compute nodes you control, not to content-addressed or blockchain-based storage. The only blockchain component is optional and narrow: a Solana devnet credit system that rewards node operators for healthy uptime.',

        No. Despite the name, the core platform is a self-hosted Docker deployment mesh -- a FastAPI control plane,
        Python node agents, and Traefik edge routing -- with no dependency on any blockchain to function. "Decentralized"
        refers to distributing container workloads across independently operated compute nodes you control, not to
        content-addressed or blockchain-based storage. The only blockchain component in the project is optional and

    question: 'Does the Solana integration involve real money or a real token I can buy or sell?',
    answerText: "No. It runs on Solana's public devnet cluster, not mainnet -- devnet SOL and tokens have no monetary value, are funded by a free public faucet, and exist purely for testing. Every mint is a real on-chain transaction with a real Explorer link, but nothing here is a security, an investment, or a purchase. A mainnet migration is an explicit future decision on the roadmap, not something this version does quietly.",

    question: 'Do I need Docker or Git installed on my own laptop to deploy?',
    answerText: "No for either, if you use dhost ship/dhost update: the CLI snapshots your project (SHA-256 content-addressed, no Git involved) and the node agent builds the Docker image server-side. If you'd rather use git push, you do need Git locally, but still not Docker -- the same server-side build pipeline runs on the other end of the SSH push.",

There's no hosted signup, no per-user accounts, and no billing -- authentication is a single shared deploy key and a single shared node-join secret, the same trust model as running your own server.

If a node that already has running deployments misses heartbeats for NODE_OFFLINE_SECONDS (180s by default -- long enough that a Docker runtime restart doesn't trigger it), the control plane automatically reschedules its deployments to another healthy node, pulling the already-built image from the mesh's shared registry with no rebuild needed. Real limitations: there's a gap between the old node going offline and the new container being ready where the app 502s, in-container state (local disk writes, in-memory data) is not migrated, and a single-node mesh has nowhere to reschedule to.",

        the new container being ready where the app returns 502s -- this is automated recovery, not zero-downtime
        failover; in-container state (local disk writes, an in-memory cache) is not migrated, only the image is

    question: 'Is there a public node network I can join to earn credits, like a DePIN marketplace?',
    answerText: "No. Every mesh is private and self-hosted -- you run your own control plane and invite only the nodes you choose to join it with your own shared secret. There's no public registry of nodes, no marketplace matching strangers' hardware to workloads, and no way to earn credits on someone else's mesh.",

If you shipped with the CLI, dhost rollback <snapshot-id> restores a local snapshot from .dhost/ledger/ and redeploys it (snapshots are local to whichever machine ran the ship, not centrally synced).
